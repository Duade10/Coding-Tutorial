# DATA TYPES

# 1. Data Types
# Data Types Examples: Strings, Integer, Boolean, List.

# TUPLE

# TUPLES ARE LISTS THAT ARE IMMUTABLE

# When you create you cannot change any of it's content
# The contents of tuples are always in between brackets ()

# LIST
# utensils = ['spoon', 'plates', 'forks']
# TUPLE
utensils = ('spoon', 'plates', 'forks')
print(utensils[0])
# Methods like pop(), append(), remove() etc are not allowed when using a TUPLE, this is because these methods change the contents of the TUPLE
